# Minesweeper
An Excel VBA project where I reproduce the basic mechanics of Minesweeper.

You can choose between a small, medium, and large board.

You can only select safe spaces. There is no ability to mark spaces as known bombs or likely bombs.

You can probably break it easily if you try. There is very little error handling, so the code itself is a minefield.
